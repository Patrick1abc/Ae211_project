 **Function:** it does not have the function to extract the file containing the result.
 
 **Performance:** Working on finding a way to translate both English and Morse easier, especially Morse to English( it seams the program works only on English to Morse). 
 
 **Updating:** Making a new file which can attach with the file `Morse_translator`, it helps the program understand the morse code putted by the user. Thus, 2 files `English_to_Morse` and `Morse_to_English` have the same functions but it different in order
