### **Creator & Editor**: P. Nguyen
### **Created**: 2024-11-1

---

### **2024-11-1**
- **Note**: Users interact with the program through the **Command Window**.
- **Update**: Successfully implemented functionality to translate from English to Morse.
- **Error**: The program could not translate from Morse to English (failed to interpret Morse code input from users).

---

### **2024-11-6**
- **Functionality**: The program lacked the ability to export the result to a file.
- **Performance**: Worked on improving translation from Morse to English (currently, the program only handled English-to-Morse translation effectively).
- **Update**: Created a new file, `morse_to_english`, to complement `morse_translator`. This update improved the program's ability to interpret user input in Morse code.
  - Both `english_to_morse` and `morse_to_english` now handle similar functions but with differing purposes and workflows.
